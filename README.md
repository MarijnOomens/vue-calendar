# vue-calendar

A calendar app I made with <a href="https://www.vuejs.org">Vue.js</a>, <a href="http://https://vuetifyjs.com/">Vuetify</a> and <a href="http://https://firebase.google.com//">Vuetify</a>. It uses the basic calendar funtionality that the Vuetify calendar provides in combination with Firebase and some custom methods and styling to provide a nice looking calendar interface with persistent cloud storage and CRUD functionality.

To use this application simply:

 - Clone this repository
 - Run npm install
 - Run npm run serve
